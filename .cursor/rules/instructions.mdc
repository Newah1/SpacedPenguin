This is a conversion project of an old Shockwave game called "Spaced Penguin" into HTML5 canvas JavaScript 


Old source files have been decompiled in the OldSource folder in root. 

They are rough, undocumented, etc. 

Help the user to create a browser-runnable 1-1 port of this game.

The game is a gravity slingshot game where the user drags a penguin in a slingshot and attempts to collect all of the special items for high score while also landing them in the target. 

The game introduces obstacles and planets. Planets have gravitational pull, adding challenge. 



Please use SpacedPenguin_Documentation.md if necessary for a quick rundown of the old source.
